# Stripe Sync

Sync Stripe Webhook events directly into your database.

## Setup

### Supabase

Synced Webhook events may contain sensitive information. Make sure to access this data using a service role Supabase client in a protected server environment.

#### Add `stripe` schema:

- [postgres.sql](/packages/stripe-sync/generated/postgres.sql)

#### Grant service role permissions

```sql
grant usage on schema stripe to service_role;
grant all privileges on all tables in schema stripe to service_role;
```

#### Deploy

Make sure to pass the `--no-verify-jwt` flat, since we want Stripe to be able to give us POST reqeusts.

```
supabase functions deploy stripe --no-verify-jwt
supabase secrets set --env-file ./supabase/.env
```

- for now, stripe-sync only works on the 2022-08-01 api version.

## Adapters

- ✅ Vercel Serverless Functions
- ✅ Vercel Edge Functions
- ✅ Netlify Functions
- ✅ Netlify Edge Functions
- ✅ Bun

## Limitations

Supabase-js cannot do cross schema joins. This may change, but in the meantime your options are:

1. put all stripe tables in public (with a `stripe_` prefix)
2. use another database client (eg. [Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely))

Additionally, the Supabase Studio dashboard/table editor becomes very slow for large numbers of tables.

## Prior Work

This project is inspired by all of the projects listed below.

- https://github.com/supabase/stripe-sync-engine

  - Needs a full blown
  - Can sync only a limited subset of Webhook events as of August 2022
  - Only syncs to Supabase

- https://www.sequin.io/

  - Their stripe sync is pretty pricey, but it's currently more mature/robust
  - Not open source
  - Only syncs to Postgres

- https://github.com/supabase/examples/blob/main/supabase-js-v1/edge-functions/supabase/functions/stripe-webhooks/index.ts

## Todos

- [ ] automatically register webhooks with stripe
- [ ] `stripe_` prefix ddl option
- [ ] webhook callback functions on for custom logic
- [ ] implement all stripe best practices
  - [ ] make event handling idempotent (https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/best-practices)
  - [ ] check that request comes from valid ip or is local development (https://stripe.com/files/ips/ips_webhooks.json)
- [ ] next.js adapter
- [ ] remix adapter
- [ ] cloudflare adapter
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] add resync
- [ ] add relations

## Tests

Currently tested on every trigger supported by the Stripe CLI.

More robust tests coming soon.
