# Stripe Sync

Sync Stripe Webhook events directly into your database.

## Setup

### Supabase

Synced Webhook events may contain sensitive information. Make sure to access this data using a service role Supabase client in a protected server environment.

#### Add `stripe` schema:

- [postgres.sql](/packages/stripe-sync/generated/postgres.sql)

#### Grant service role permissions

```sql
grant usage on schema stripe to service_role;
grant all privileges on all tables in schema stripe to service_role;
```

#### Deploy

Make sure to pass the `--no-verify-jwt` flat, since we want Stripe to be able to give us POST reqeusts.

```
supabase functions deploy stripe --no-verify-jwt
supabase secrets set --env-file ./supabase/.env
```

- for now, stripe-sync only works on the 2022-08-01 api version. 

#### Limitations

Supabase-js cannot do cross schema joins. This may change, but in the meantime your options are:

1) put all stripe tables in public (with a `stripe_` prefix)
2) use another database client (eg. [Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely))
